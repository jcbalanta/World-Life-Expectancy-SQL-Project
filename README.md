# World-Life-Expectancy-SQL-Project
 
 This project aims to analyze global life expectancy using a dataset that includes variables such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), life expectancy, Body Mass Index (BMI), and other related factors. The project was divided into two main parts: the first involved data cleaning using SQL commands, where duplicates were removed, missing values were filled in, and data formats were standardized to facilitate analysis. In the second part, an exploratory data analysis was conducted, focusing on key variables such as GDP, life expectancy, countries, and BMI. During the analysis, several interesting insights were found, such as the increase in life expectancy in countries over the last 15 years, the calculation of average life expectancy per year, and the identification of a positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy, suggesting that countries with higher GDP tend to have higher life expectancy. Additionally, it was highlighted that the difference in life expectancy between countries with low GDP and those with high GDP is about 10 years. This project demonstrates how data analysis can reveal significant patterns about public health and global economics, providing a foundation for future research on how to improve quality of life and reduce inequalities worldwide
